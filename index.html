    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a working professional passionate about building projects involving data
    development, analytics, data science, web scraping, automation, machine learning,
    etc. I am confident in my problem-solving, critical thinking, analysis,
    organization, and research skills. I am a homebody who prefers the company of a
    few friends for food trips, karaoke sessions, and fitness goals. I have over
    30 playthroughs in Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 3 if that matters. I can
    discuss in detail why "The IT Crowd" is the best comedy show out there and
    why "Moon Knight" deserves a second season. I can take a bit of time to
    warm up to people, but when I do, I can be chatty about topics I am
    passionate about.</p>

        <p>Extracted stock data of TESLA using API. Used list comprehension to determine yesterday's
            date and the day before yesterday's date. Extracted closing stock prices for both yesterday
            and the day before yesterday from generated stock data, then computes the percentage
            increase or decrease. If the increase is greater than 5%, data from news site
            is extracted using API. The first three relevant news are sent to telegram using
            telegram bot to show possible reasons behind the increase of the stock price of TESLA.</p><br>

        <p>Replicated Angela Yu's flight deals exercise, a capstone project that uses environment variables, API, requests library, object oriented programming, datetime module, and smtplib. First, a get request was made to fetch data of lowest prices from google sheet. Second, a get request was sent to Tequila to fetch city codes using locations API. Third, a put request was performed to populate iATA codes of cities in the google sheet. Fourth, datetime module and time delta was used to determine date for tomorrow and for the next six months. Fifth, another get request was sent to Tequila using search API to fetch flight data from tomorrow up to six months from origin city to destination cities. If destination price from the result is lower than what's listed in the google sheet, an alert will be sent through e-mail. Stopovers/layovers and booking links were determined from the data generated from Tequila. Used cutt.ly API to shorten the generated link. Environment variables were used to hide sensitive data.</p><br>
