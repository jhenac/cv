                <p><em>Aspiring Data Scientist</em></p>
                <p>I am a working professional passionate about building projects involving data
                    development, analytics, data science, web scraping, automation, machine learning,
                    etc. I am confident in my problem-solving, critical thinking, analysis,
                    organization, and research skills. I am a homebody who prefers the company of a
                    few friends for food trips, karaoke sessions, and fitness goals. I have over
                    30 playthroughs in Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 3 if that matters. I can
                    discuss in detail why "The IT Crowd" is the best comedy show out there and
                    why "Moon Knight" deserves a second season. I can take a bit of time to
                    warm up to people, but when I do, I can be chatty about topics I am
                    passionate about.</p>
